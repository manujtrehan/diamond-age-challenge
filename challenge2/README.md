# Background

After watching Tom Cruiseâ€™s captivating performance in Top Gun: Maverick, Diamond Age is considering a pivot into the flight simulator business with the goal of providing a 6 Degree of Freedom flight simulator to all aspiring fighter jet pilots across the country.

Diamond Age would like to build our proprietary flight simulator for the masses on top of a Stewart Platform. In order to fulfill our mission of providing flight simulators to the masses, we need you to develop an Inverse Kinematics solver that maps 6 DoF commands into leg lengths for the Stewart Platform.

## Milestone #1

Using the language of your choice, write an inverse kinematics solver for a 6 Degree of Freedom Stewart Platform

## Discussion

Discuss the difficulties of implementing a forward kinematics solver for a Stewart Platform. How is this different from a serial manipulator? How would you go about solving this problem?
