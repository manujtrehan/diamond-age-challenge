# Project
Use MoveIt to execute a pick & place operation that stacks two blocks on top of each other. Leverage the Panda arm environment provided in the MoveIt install.

## Milestone #1

Create a node that exposes a service to randomly add two boxes to the planning scene

## Milestone #2

Write a service that when called, plans and executes a motion that stacks on box on the other

### Bonus: Use an action instead of a service
